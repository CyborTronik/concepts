      <article><h1>Re-structured Communication Types</h1>
        <p>An imense amount of books and sources have missalignments in the way of mixing the <a href="/concepts/categories/domain/2023/03/19/architecture_type_by_domain.html">software architecture types</a> with the way communication and have it in one backet as “Categories of Architecture”.</p>

<p>To avoid that confusion in addition to the <a href="/concepts/categories/domain/2023/03/19/architecture_type_by_domain.html">re-structured software architecture types</a> below is the concise suggestion of the ways of interaction between system or software artifacts.</p>

<p>Kind of software interactions:</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Alias/Reference</th>
      <th>Attributes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Blocking request</em></td>
      <td>syncronious communication</td>
      <td>Blocked process untill gets the result.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Async request</em></td>
      <td>asyncronious communication</td>
      <td>Blocking request that gets a reference ID immediately, and multiple requests after that (pulling), that checks the result based on the reference ID.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Notify request</em></td>
      <td>event based communication, also fire and forget <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></td>
      <td>One way communication. A kind of request that doesn’t wait for response.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Subscriber</em></td>
      <td>event based communication</td>
      <td>Actually only receiving <strong>responses</strong> not requesting them. Low load, eventual consistency.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Realtime processing</em></td>
      <td>streaming</td>
      <td>Pulling (almost listening) or push-based data and receiving results as soon as they are ready to be processed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Bulk processing</em></td>
      <td>batch jobs</td>
      <td>One time processing of big amount of data. Resource hungry. Has eventual consistency.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
